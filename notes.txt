Implement Firefox's Panarama function using the power of HTML5
	Canvas tag, SVG, etc
	
	
Allow pinned tabs to exist outside of the panarama structure
	Pinned tabs are not saved by the extension

	The extension in meant to be used in conjunction with the
	"open tabs used last time" function of Chrome.
		Building off of this, the extension should have a default
		space that starts with Chrome.
			Implement this perhaps with a temp file which is created
			on startup
				If the file is there, a new session of Chrome has been
				started, so load the default space.
Save tabs as bookmarks
	Has the side benefit of allowing the extension to sync across multiple computers.
	Also, it would make it pretty easy to move tabs to non-active "workspaces"
	
Allow multiple "workspaces" open at once
	Different windows, different "workspaces"

Build timeout on "workspaces"
	Tabs will stay open for a little bit before closing, unless memory is a concern.
	
	I don't think memory can be assessed directly, so it will have to be assumed to be a f(x) of
	the number of tabs
	
Prevent opening the same page twice
	Bookmark the page when the page is opened
	Before that, make sure that the bookmark does not already exist
		If it does exist, close the tab that was just opened

Restore a workspace on startup
	This could be a default workspace, or the last workspace used.
	
	Could merely be the panarama view.
	
	
Alternative structure - Multiple buttons acting together
	Storage
		Show the current stack of where to store tabs
	Push
		Push to the stack specified by storage
	Pop
		Pop the most recent one in storage
	Active
		Show the active workspace on mouseover
		Switch workspaces with menu on click
			Allow for multi-column menu
