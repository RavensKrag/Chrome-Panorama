Implement Firefox's Panarama function using the power of HTML5
	Canvas tag, SVG, etc
	
	
Allow pinned tabs to exist outside of the panarama structure
	Pinned tabs are not saved by the extension

	The extension in meant to be used in conjunction with the
	"open tabs used last time" function of Chrome.
		Building off of this, the extension should have a default
		space that starts with Chrome.
			Implement this perhaps with a temp file which is created
			on startup
				If the file is there, a new session of Chrome has been
				started, so load the default space.
